## C++ Fundamentals: Data Structures and OOPs

---

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C%2B%2B-blue.svg)](https://isocpp.org/)

This repository is a structured collection of C++ programs focused on mastering core language features, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** principles, and **fundamental Data Structures**, primarily **Linked Lists**. It serves as a practical, hands-on learning resource for developers.

## üìö Key Topics and Implementations

The code examples are categorized by concept for easy reference and learning.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
* **Core Concepts:** Implementation of **Classes**, **Objects**, and access modifiers (`private.cpp`).
* **Constructors:** Examples for **Default**, **Parameterized**, and **Multiple Constructors**.
* **Inheritance:** Demonstrations of **Single** and **Multiple Inheritance**.
* **Memory Management:** Use of object **Pointers**, the **`this`** pointer, and **Dynamic Memory Allocation**.

### Linked Lists
A comprehensive set of implementations covering all major list types and operations:
* **Singly Linked List (SLL):** Insertion and traversal operations.
* **Doubly Linked List (DLL):** Creation from arrays, insertion (Head, Tail, at Kth position), and deletion operations.
* **Circular Linked List (CLL):** Basic structure and operations.

### C++ Basics
* Clear examples illustrating **Pass by Value** vs. **Pass by Reference** for function arguments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the examples in this repository, you only need a standard C++ compiler.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ Compiler (e.g., **g++**).

### Compilation and Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dipti-2211/Cpp.git](https://github.com/dipti-2211/Cpp.git)
    cd Cpp
    ```
2.  **Compile any file (e.g., `insertll.cpp`):**
    ```bash
    g++ insertll.cpp -o run_program
    ```
3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./run_program
    ```
